The menu subsystem manages menu items for each event. When a new event is
created the application stores a canonical `event_file` document under
`/events/{eventId}/meta/event_file`. This document now starts with an empty
`menu` list instead of pre‑generated meal entries.

`menu_viewer_ui` provides the interface for viewing and editing an event’s
menu. Each existing item is editable in place and all changes are persisted to
the `event_file`. Adding a menu item immediately updates the stored JSON and
refreshes the interface so no separate save step is required.

`menu_editor_ui` (used less frequently) follows the same pattern—all menu
entries are written back to the event document automatically when the screen is
rendered.

These changes remove the previous logic that generated placeholder menu items
based on event duration and eliminate the explicit “Save Menu” buttons. Menu
items are stored per event and are displayed in the event planning dashboard
through the menu viewer component.
