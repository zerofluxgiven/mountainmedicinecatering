# Recipe Bullet Points Fix - July 15, 2025

## Issue
Recipe instructions parsed from URLs were displaying as continuous paragraphs without bullet points, making them hard to read. Screenshots showed the BYU Creamery Ranch Dressing recipe with instructions running together.

## Root Cause
The Firebase function `parseRecipe` was returning instructions as plain text without formatting. While the client-side code had a `formatInstructionsAsSteps` function, it wasn't being used by the server-side parser.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Bullet Point Formatting Function
Added `formatInstructionsWithBullets()` function to `/functions/recipes/parser.js` that:
- Splits instructions by sentence endings and line breaks
- Removes existing numbering or bullets
- Adds bullet points (•) to each step
- Handles edge cases for short fragments and empty lines

### 2. Applied Formatting in Recipe Validation
Updated `validateRecipeData()` to call `formatInstructionsWithBullets()` on all instructions:
- For string instructions: formats directly
- For array instructions: joins then formats
- For structured data from websites: formats after extraction

### 3. Updated CSS for Better Display
Modified `/src/pages/Recipes/RecipeViewer.css` to:
- Add proper indentation for bullet points (1.5rem padding-left)
- Use negative text-indent to align bullets properly
- Hide empty paragraphs that might result from parsing

### 4. Updated AI Prompt
Modified the recipe parsing prompt to instruct the AI to separate steps clearly for better formatting.

## Files Modified
1. `/functions/recipes/parser.js` - Added bullet point formatting
2. `/src/pages/Recipes/RecipeViewer.css` - Updated styling for bullet points

## Testing
Created test script that verified the formatting function correctly transforms:
```
Assemble the coarse ground black pepper, dried parsley...
```

Into:
```
• Assemble the coarse ground black pepper, dried parsley...
• Put all ingredients into a food processor...
• Put the BYU Ranch Dry Mix into a glass container...
```

## Result
Recipe instructions now display with clear bullet points, making them much easier to read and follow during cooking.

## Deployment
- Firebase Functions: Updated parseRecipe function deployed
- React App: Built and deployed with updated CSS
