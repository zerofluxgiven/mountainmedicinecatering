# Recipe Parser Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase parseRecipe Function Validation Too Strict
**Problem**: The Firebase function was rejecting recipes with missing fields, throwing "Recipe validation failed: missing name, empty ingredients array"

**Solution**: 
- Modified `validateRecipeData()` in `functions/recipes/parser.js` to be more lenient
- Now provides default values for missing fields instead of throwing errors
- Only fails if absolutely no useful data can be extracted
- Better handles edge cases where OpenAI returns incomplete data

### 2. Local Parser Rejecting Image Files
**Problem**: When Firebase function failed, the local parser would throw errors for image/PDF files instead of gracefully handling them

**Solution**:
- Updated `parseRecipeFromFile()` in `src/services/recipeParser.js` 
- Now returns a basic recipe template for images/PDFs when Firebase is unavailable
- Users can manually fill in the details in the editor
- Better error handling for all file types

### 3. Instructions Format Handling
**Problem**: Instructions could be either string or array format, causing display issues

**Solution**:
- Added processing in both Firebase parser and save function to handle both formats
- Converts string instructions to array when saving
- Properly displays both formats in the preview

### 4. Null Safety for Ingredients
**Problem**: Null/undefined ingredients array causing crashes in the editor

**Solution**:
- Added null safety checks in all ingredient manipulation functions
- Uses `(parsedRecipe.ingredients || [])` pattern throughout

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Try uploading an image file of a recipe
2. If Firebase is unavailable, it should return a basic template
3. The editor should display properly with empty fields
4. You should be able to add ingredients and instructions
5. Save should work correctly

## Deployment
Firebase functions have been deployed with the fixes:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
