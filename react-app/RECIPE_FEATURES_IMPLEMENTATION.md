# Recipe Features Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of three key features for the recipe management system.

## 1. Recipe Image Parsing from URLs

### Implementation
- **Updated Firebase Function** (`functions/recipes/parser.js`):
  - Added `extractImageUrl()` function to extract images from structured data (JSON-LD)
  - Added `extractImageFromHtml()` function to find images in HTML using various selectors
  - Modified `parseRecipeFromURL()` to extract and include image URLs in parsed recipes
  - Support for various image formats: direct URLs, og:image meta tags, schema.org markup

### How it Works
When parsing a recipe from a URL:
1. First checks for structured data (JSON-LD) with image properties
2. Falls back to searching HTML for recipe images using common selectors
3. Includes the image URL in the parsed recipe data

## 2. Photo Upload in Recipe Editor

### Implementation
- **Storage Service** (`services/storageService.js`):
  - `uploadRecipeImage()`: Uploads and resizes images to Firebase Storage
  - `downloadAndUploadImage()`: Downloads external images and saves to our storage
  - Automatic image resizing to max 1200x1200px while maintaining aspect ratio
  - JPEG compression for optimal file size

- **Recipe Editor Updates** (`pages/Recipes/RecipeEditor.jsx`):
  - Added image upload button with file input
  - Support for both file upload and URL input
  - Image preview with remove option
  - Automatic download and storage of external image URLs
  - Upload progress indicator

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Dual input method: file upload or URL paste
  - Real-time preview of selected images
  - Clear labeling of current vs new images
  - Responsive design for mobile devices

### Features
- Drag & drop support (via hidden file input)
- Image standardization (resize to max 1200x1200)
- JPEG conversion for consistent format
- Secure storage in Firebase Storage
- Automatic URL migration from external sources

## 3. Auto-detect Allergens and Tags

### Implementation
- **Allergen Detector Service** (`services/allergenDetector.js`):
  - `detectAllergens()`: Analyzes ingredients for common allergens
  - `suggestTags()`: Suggests tags based on recipe content
  - `analyzeRecipe()`: Combined analysis returning both allergens and tags

### Allergen Detection
Detects these common allergens:
- Dairy (milk, cheese, butter, cream, etc.)
- Eggs
- Gluten (wheat, flour, bread, pasta)
- Tree Nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc.)
- Peanuts
- Soy (tofu, tempeh, soy sauce)
- Fish
- Shellfish
- Sesame

### Tag Suggestions
Automatically suggests tags for:
- **Dietary**: Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free
- **Meal Types**: Breakfast, Dessert, Appetizer, Main Course, Side Dish, Soup, Salad
- **Cooking Methods**: Baked, Grilled, No-Cook
- **Time-based**: Quick & Easy (â‰¤30 minutes)
- **Appliances**: Slow Cooker, Instant Pot

### Integration Points
1. **Recipe Editor**:
   - Real-time detection as ingredients are typed
   - Toggle to enable/disable auto-detection
   - Preserves manually added allergens/tags
   - Final analysis on save

2. **Recipe Import**:
   - Automatic analysis of parsed recipes
   - Merges detected items with parsed data
   - Handles images from parsed URLs

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`__tests__/allergenDetector.test.js`) covering:
- Allergen detection accuracy
- False positive prevention (e.g., "almond milk" not flagged as dairy)
- Tag suggestion logic
- Edge cases and invalid inputs

## Usage Examples

### Uploading a Recipe Image
```javascript
// In Recipe Editor
1. Click "Upload Image" button
2. Select image file from device
3. Image is automatically resized and preview shown
4. On save, image uploads to Firebase Storage
```

### Parsing Recipe from URL
```javascript
// When importing from URL
1. Enter recipe URL
2. System extracts recipe data including image
3. Image URL is captured and can be saved to our storage
4. Allergens and tags are auto-detected
```

### Auto-detection in Editor
```javascript
// While editing ingredients
1. Type "2 cups milk, 3 eggs"
2. System automatically detects "Dairy" and "Eggs" allergens
3. Tags suggested based on recipe content
4. Toggle off auto-detect to manage manually
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Visual Experience**: Recipes now include images for better browsing
2. **Consistent Image Quality**: All images standardized to optimal size
3. **Safety Awareness**: Automatic allergen detection helps prevent issues
4. **Improved Organization**: Auto-tagging helps categorize recipes
5. **Time Saving**: Reduces manual data entry
6. **Storage Efficiency**: Images optimized for web delivery

## Future Enhancements

1. Multiple image support per recipe
2. Image cropping tool
3. Custom allergen definitions
4. Machine learning for better tag suggestions
5. Batch processing for existing recipes
6. Image CDN integration for faster delivery
