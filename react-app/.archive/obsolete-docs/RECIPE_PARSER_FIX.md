# Recipe Parser Fix - Preserving Ingredient Measurements

## Issue
The recipe parser in the React app was not preserving ingredient measurements when parsing recipes from files or URLs. Ingredients like "2 cups flour" were being stored as just "flour".

## Root Cause
The AI parsing prompts in the Firebase Functions were not explicitly instructing the AI to preserve exact quantities and measurements for ingredients.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Firebase Function Parser (`functions/recipes/parser.js`)

#### Main Recipe Parsing Prompt
- Added explicit instructions to preserve exact quantities, measurements, and units
- Added examples of proper ingredient extraction
- Emphasized keeping fractions and ranges exactly as written

#### Image Parsing Prompt
- Updated the prompt for image-based recipe parsing
- Added specific instructions to preserve measurements when extracting from images
- Added examples to guide the AI

### 2. Updated Development Mock Parser (`src/services/recipeParser.js`)
- Fixed the regex pattern to preserve measurements when cleaning ingredient lines
- Changed from removing all digits to only removing bullet point numbers

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
1. Start the Firebase emulators:
   ```bash
   cd react-app
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

2. Test recipe parsing with a file or URL that contains measurements

### Production Deployment
To deploy the updated Firebase Functions:
```bash
cd react-app
firebase deploy --only functions:parseRecipe
```

## Expected Results
After these changes, recipe ingredients should be stored with their full measurements:
- Before: ["flour", "salt", "eggs"]
- After: ["2 cups flour", "1/2 teaspoon salt", "3 large eggs"]

## Additional Considerations

### Future Improvements
1. The legacy Streamlit app had a more sophisticated ingredient parsing system that separated quantity, unit, and ingredient name. This could be implemented in the React app for better ingredient management and shopping list generation.

2. Consider adding a structured ingredient format:
   ```javascript
   ingredients: [
     { quantity: "2", unit: "cups", name: "flour" },
     { quantity: "1/2", unit: "teaspoon", name: "salt" }
   ]
   ```

3. The recipe scaler already has logic to parse ingredient amounts, so the infrastructure exists to support structured ingredients.

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Import a recipe with clear measurements
2. Check that the ingredients display includes quantities
3. Test the recipe scaler to ensure it can still parse the ingredient amounts
