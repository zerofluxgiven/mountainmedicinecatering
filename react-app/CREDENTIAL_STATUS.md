# Credential Configuration Status ✅

## Current Configuration

### ✅ Firebase Credentials (From Streamlit App)
The React app is now using the **same Firebase project** as your Streamlit app:

- **Project ID**: `mountainmedicine-6e572`
- **Project URL**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mountainmedicine-6e572
- **Auth Domain**: mountainmedicine-6e572.firebaseapp.com
- **Storage Bucket**: mountainmedicine-6e572.firebasestorage.app

### ✅ Benefits of Using Same Firebase Project

1. **Shared Database**: All your existing data from the Streamlit app is immediately available
2. **Same Users**: Existing user accounts work without changes
3. **Same Storage**: Recipe images and files are already there
4. **No Migration**: No need to move any data
5. **Consistent State**: Both apps can run simultaneously if needed

### ⚠️ Still Needed for Full Functionality

1. **OpenAI API Key for Functions**
   ```bash
   # If you want AI features in Firebase Functions:
   firebase functions:config:set openai.key="your-openai-key-from-streamlit"
   ```

2. **Deploy Security Rules**
   ```bash
   # Deploy the security rules to protect your data:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
   ```

3. **Deploy Firebase Functions** (Optional, for AI features)
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   cd ..
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

### 📱 Testing the App

The app should now be able to:
- ✅ Connect to your Firebase project
- ✅ Authenticate users (use same login as Streamlit)
- ✅ Read/write data to Firestore
- ✅ Upload/download files from Storage
- ✅ Access all existing recipes, events, menus, etc.

### 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Frontend Config is Safe**: The Firebase config in `.env.local` is safe to expose (it's public)
2. **Backend Secrets**: Keep OpenAI API key secret (only in Functions config)
3. **Security Rules**: The included `firestore.rules` enforce proper access control

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Login**: Try logging in with your existing Streamlit app credentials
2. **Verify Data**: Check that all your recipes, events, and menus appear
3. **Test Features**: All features should work with your existing data
4. **Deploy** (when ready):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   firebase deploy
   ```

### 📊 Connection Status

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Firebase Auth | ✅ Ready | Same users as Streamlit |
| Firestore | ✅ Ready | Same database |
| Storage | ✅ Ready | Same files |
| Functions | ⏳ Pending | Need to deploy |
| OpenAI | ⏳ Pending | Need API key |
