# AI Agents & Context Guide

This file serves as a central index for AI agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) to quickly understand the Mountain Medicine Kitchen codebase and find relevant documentation.

## üöÄ Quick Start for AI Agents

If you're an AI assistant working on this codebase, start here:

1. **Read `CLAUDE.md`** - Complete architecture reference (993 lines)
2. **Check `MANUAL_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md`** - For ANY permission/403/CORS errors!
3. **Check current branch**: `git branch --show-current`
4. **Review recent changes**: `git log --oneline -10`
5. **Understand the project state**: Read the relevant guides below

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING - Component Confusion Fixed

**As of July 2025, duplicate components have been removed:**
- **Menu Editing**: Use `MenuPlannerCalendar` (in MenuPlannerWrapper), NOT MenuEditor (deleted)
- **AI Chat**: Use `components/AI/AIChat.jsx`, NOT pages/Chat/AIChat (deleted)
- **Check App.jsx routes** to see which components are actually used

**This cleanup fixed issues where changes didn't appear because the wrong component was being edited!**

## üö® CRITICAL: Permission Errors
**If you encounter 403, CORS, or permission errors:**
- IMMEDIATELY check `/react-app/MANUAL_PERMISSIONS_GUIDE.md`
- Tell the user EXACTLY what manual steps they need to take
- DO NOT try to fix permissions in code - they require manual Firebase/Google Cloud Console changes

## üî• Current TODO Items (January 2025)

### High Priority
1. **AI History Tracking Enhancement**
   - Track ALL AI actions in AI History tab
   - Monitor `ai_assistant` actions in Firestore
   - Show complete audit trail of AI-driven changes
   - Files: `/src/pages/AI/AIHistory.jsx`, `/functions/src/ai/aiActions.js`

2. **Conversation Management System**
   - Add ability to start new chats without deleting old ones
   - Create conversation sidebar for accessing previous chats
   - Restore AI context when loading old conversations
   - Files: `/src/components/AI/AIChat.jsx`, `/src/services/aiConversationHistory.js`

### Recently Completed (July 2025)
- ‚úÖ **MAJOR CLEANUP: Fixed Duplicate Components**
  - Removed duplicate AIChat (pages/Chat/AIChat.jsx) - was causing inconsistent behavior
  - Deleted unused MenuEditor (658 lines) and MenuPlanner (29 lines) 
  - Now only ONE version of each component exists
  - Fixed issues where UI changes didn't appear (wrong components were being edited)
- ‚úÖ AI Smart Detection System - Recipes detected with 75%+ confidence
- ‚úÖ Pre-parsed Recipe Data - No more brittle regex patterns
- ‚úÖ Curly Quote Support - Handles 'You'll need:' regardless of quote style
- ‚úÖ Format Agnostic Detection - Works with prose, lists, conversations
- ‚úÖ Zero Extra AI Calls - Detection integrated into response generation
- ‚úÖ Fixed AI message truncation (increased tokens to 4000)
- ‚úÖ Fixed conversation history persistence
- ‚úÖ Added recipe saving from AI chat with approval flow
- ‚úÖ Implemented "Edit this recipe" button in approval dialog
- ‚úÖ Fixed CORS issues with HTTP endpoint fallbacks

## üõí Shopping List System (Current State)

### What's Implemented:
1. **ShoppingListGenerator** - Basic list generation with grouping options
2. **SmartShoppingList** - AI-powered optimization with store recommendations
3. **Shopping Intelligence Service** - Store profiles, package sizes, AI analysis
4. **Export Options** - Text, CSV, PDF formats
5. **Integration** - Pulls from Event ‚Üí Menus ‚Üí Recipes ‚Üí Ingredients

### AI Features:
- Shopping modes (Minimize Stores, Budget, Quality, Balanced)
- Store strength analysis (knows Costco = bulk, Whole Foods = premium)
- Route optimization across multiple stores
- Package size intelligence for bulk buying

### TODO - Shopping List Enhancements:
- Persistent storage in Firestore
- Check-off functionality while shopping
- Price estimation and budgeting
- Store API integration for real prices
- Barcode generation
- Mobile shopping companion view
- Share lists via email/SMS
